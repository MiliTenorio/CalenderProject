Just Completed Calendar Application Project!🗓️ 

I'm excited to announce the final version of my project - a Calendar Application developed using Java and MySQL.
🚀 The main features are CRUD operations, design with MVC architecture, robust data management in MySQL through customized SQL commands.
🔍 But during the course of the project I realized that it would be interesting to extend the programming to use the Spring Data Framework, and this will be the project's new challenge.
